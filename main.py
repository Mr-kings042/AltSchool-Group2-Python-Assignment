# âœ… GET /assignments/
# List all submitted assignments

# Create ann endpoint that gets all the assignments submitted by a student,
# To do this, i should be able to grab all students Id, and check if all student has submitted an assignment
# If a student is present and has no assignment submitted, there should be an http response with a 404 status code
# But if a student is present and has submitted an assignment, the response should be a 200 status code
# and return all the assignments, I think the assignments should return with a namee, So it coould be:
# Name: Johndoe
# Assignemt: 'The assignment payload' (If there is an assignment submitted)
# And if there is no assignment submitted, it should return:
# Name: Johndoe
# No assignment submitted

# I can also try to see if all details can be pushed into a list, and reeturn the list after it is done checking for the assignments and names or student id
